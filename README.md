# 🧰 SQL Server DBA Projects (Internship at ADY)

Hey! 👋 This repo includes a full set of SQL Server DBA projects I worked on during my internship at ADY (Azerbaijan Railways), guided by Rauf Asasdov.

These tasks helped me understand what it really means to be a DBA — from setting up backups to analyzing error logs.
